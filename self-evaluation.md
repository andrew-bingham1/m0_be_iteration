# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

    - During my pair coding session 2 my partner had already finished the lesson and so we implemented parts of it into that. Having had the exposure to it the lesson itself was pretty easy. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

    - There certainly was a moment where I had to step away and let the practice stew in my head a moment. When I came back the conditional lesson came back to me and I was able to make quick progress through the rest of the assignment. I also had to look up the `variable.include?` method yesterday so did not have to struggle too much today on that portion. I would definitely say the struggle was productive. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

    - I think I have a good grasp of `each` however I am going back to some lessons I did struggle on and see if I can utilize it in those. More practice will make perfect. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

    - The `each` method is honestly pretty cool as is creating the second variable. I am curious if there are other cornerstone methods like that and am going to look on the internet to see if I can find some like it just to get exposure to them.
